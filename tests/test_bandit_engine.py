"""Wave 1 acceptance tests for the BANDIT engine.

Coverage:
  1. Determinism under fixed seed: same arm-pull sequence every run.
  2. Different seed produces a different sequence (anti-vacuity).
  3. Decision parity: adaptive and exhaustive reach identical verdicts.
  4. Hoeffding stopping: FAIL detected before budget exhaustion.
  5. Advisory controls do not gate the verdict.
  6. MCSS: ordering improves with accumulated evaluations.
  7. Required-pass-rate derivation for rate-type and error-rate-type thresholds.

All tests use the fixture in tests/fixtures/bandit_test_controls.json.
That file is labelled TEST FIXTURE ONLY and contains no governance content.

Suite runner: MockSuiteRunner. Probe outcomes are pre-configured at
construction. The runner is deterministic: same control_id always yields the
same outcome. The engine's RNG provides any tie-breaking needed by UCB1.
