"""Inter-evaluation suite-ordering warm-start layer.

STATUS: dormant. The proof path (prove_reduction.py) constructs BanditEngine
directly and does not wire the MCSS warm-start. The production path
(run_e2e.py) and the API route run suites exhaustively and do not use the
engine at all. This layer is not exercised by any current evaluation path.
It is retained because the mechanism is sound and the wiring task is well-
defined; see docs/FLOW.md for the integration plan.

NAMING NOTE
===========
This module was initially named "Monte Carlo Strategy Search". That name
implies rollout-based search over orderings, which this module does not do.
The mechanism is a simpler inter-evaluation warm-start: historical mean
rewards per suite are recorded after each evaluation and used to set the
initial arm ordering for the next evaluation of the same use-case class.
UCB1 then takes over once every arm has been pulled at least once. This is
more accurately described as a reward-sorted warm-start.

WHAT IS BEING LEARNT
====================
The layer learns the best *initial arm ordering* for each use-case class:
which suite should be pulled first, second, and so on, to maximise expected
information gain per query. This is the state the engine enters each
evaluation with before UCB1 takes over.

State space: a partial ordering over the arms (suites) for a given
use-case class. The state that matters for learning is which suite was
pulled in which position, and what mean reward it yielded in that position.

Learning mechanism: after each completed evaluation, the layer updates a
statistics table that maps (use_case_class, suite_id) to the historical mean
information-gain-per-query for that suite in evaluations of this class. The
next evaluation starts with arms ordered by this historical mean, descending.
UCB1 then overrides this ordering once it has enough observations to improve
on the warm-start.

COMPOUNDING CLAIM
=================
Evaluation N+1 of the same use-case class starts with a better arm ordering
than evaluation N, until the ordering converges. Convergence is detectable:
once the warm-start ordering matches the UCB1 exploitation order from the
most recent evaluation, no further improvement is possible from ordering alone.

The improvement is measurable as: average probes-to-verdict for evaluations
of the same class decreases as total_evaluations increases, when plotted
against a random-ordering baseline.

WHAT THIS LAYER DOES NOT DO
============================
This layer does not search the exponential space of all orderings via
rollouts. That would be a full Monte Carlo tree search and is not implemented
here. The arm space is small (eight suites at most), the evaluation budget is
finite, and UCB1 already handles the exploitation-exploration trade-off within
each evaluation. This layer adds only inter-evaluation learning of a good
warm-start, not a within-evaluation search over orderings.

PERSISTENCE
===========
MCSS state is stored in the engine_memory table, keyed by use_case_class.
Each row holds:
  suite_ordering: JSON list of suite_ids in learnt descending order.
  arm_statistics: JSON object mapping suite_id to {mean_reward, pulls}.
  total_evaluations: count of completed evaluations contributing to this row.

The MIZAN DB layer (database.py) provides the session factory. MCSSLayer
wraps the raw SQLAlchemy calls.
